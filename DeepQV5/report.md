Executive Summary
The agent's failure stems from three core issues:

Flawed Reward System: The reward for making a profit was not strong enough to outweigh the risk of loss, and the penalty for inaction was negligible.
Ineffective Exploration: The switch to Noisy Networks without proper configuration and a decaying noise schedule meant the agent never effectively explored profitable strategies.
Limited State Awareness: The agent lacked crucial context about its own performance and the market's momentum, preventing it from making informed decisions.
This guide will walk you through a complete refactoring of the TradingEnvironment and DQNAgent to create a robust system that actively trades and optimizes for realized capital growth.

Comprehensive Implementation Guide
Follow these sections in order. Each change includes the WHY (the reasoning), WHERE (the function or class to modify), and WHAT (the specific code to add or replace).

Section 1: Core Fixes â€” Making the Agent Trade Profitably
This is the most critical section to fix the "zero trades" error.

1.1. Overhaul the Reward Function

WHY: The primary goal is to make realized profit (credit growth) the most desirable outcome, penalize inaction, and provide small nudges for holding good positions.
WHERE: TradingEnvironment.step()
WHAT: Replace the entire reward calculation section at the end of the method with this new, multi-component logic.
    # --- REWARD CALCULATION (REPLACE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK) ---
    
    # 1. PRIMARY REWARD: Realized credit growth. This is the main objective.
    # Heavily reward realized profits, and penalize realized losses.
    credit_delta = self.credit - prev_credit
    reward = credit_delta * 1.0  # Scaled reward for realized PnL

    # 2. INCENTIVE FOR HOLDING WINNERS (Unrealized PnL)
    # Add a small, bounded reward for being in a profitable open position.
    # This encourages the agent to not sell too early.
    if self.holdings > 0 and self.average_buy_price > 0:
        unrealized_gain_ratio = (current_price - self.average_buy_price) / self.average_buy_price
        # Use tanh to create a bounded reward between -0.1 and +0.1
        reward += np.tanh(unrealized_gain_ratio * 5) * 0.1 

    # 3. PENALTY FOR INACTION
    # Make the penalty stronger if the agent is just sitting on cash.
    if action_idx == 2: # Index for action '0' (Hold)
        if self.holdings == 0:
            reward -= 0.05 # Stronger penalty for holding cash and doing nothing
        else:
            reward -= 0.01 # Smaller penalty for holding a position

    # 4. BONUS FOR REACHING NEW CREDIT HIGHS
    # A bonus for "banking" profits and increasing the capital base.
    if self.credit > self.max_credit:
        reward += (self.credit - self.max_credit) * 0.1 # Bonus for new credit high
        self.max_credit = self.credit

    # Update portfolio value high-water mark (for state representation)
    if portfolio_value > self.max_portfolio_value:
        self.max_portfolio_value = portfolio_value

    if done:
        # Liquidate remaining holdings at the end of the episode
        self.credit += self.holdings * current_price * (1 - self.fee)
        self.holdings = 0
        portfolio_value = self.credit

    return next_state, reward, done, {
        "portfolio_value": portfolio_value,
        "credit": self.credit,
        "holdings": self.holdings,
        "trades": self.trades,
    }
1.2. Fix Noisy Networks for Better Exploration

WHY: The default noise settings can be too chaotic. We need to start with less noise and let it be learned. The original paper also uses a factorized noise approach which is more stable.
WHERE: NoisyLinear class.
WHAT: Replace the __init__, reset_parameters, and forward methods.
class NoisyLinear(nn.Module):
"""
Noisy Linear Layer for exploration. Replaces epsilon-greedy.
Reference: "Noisy Networks for Exploration" (Fortunato et al., 2017)
This version uses Factorised Gaussian noise for stability.
"""
def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, sigma_init=0.5):
    super().__init__()
    self.in_features = in_features
    self.out_features = out_features
    self.sigma_init = sigma_init

    self.mu_w = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_features, in_features))
    self.sigma_w = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_features, in_features))
    self.register_buffer("eps_w", torch.empty(out_features, in_features))

    self.mu_b = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_features))
    self.sigma_b = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_features))
    self.register_buffer("eps_b", torch.empty(out_features))

    self.reset_parameters()
    self.reset_noise()

def reset_parameters(self):
    mu_range = 1 / math.sqrt(self.in_features)
    self.mu_w.data.uniform_(-mu_range, mu_range)
    self.mu_b.data.uniform_(-mu_range, mu_range)
    # Initialize sigma with a value from the paper, scaled by input size
    self.sigma_w.data.fill_(self.sigma_init / math.sqrt(self.in_features))
    self.sigma_b.data.fill_(self.sigma_init / math.sqrt(self.out_features))

def _scale_noise(self, size):
    x = torch.randn(size)
    return x.sign().mul(x.abs().sqrt())

def reset_noise(self):
    # Factorised Gaussian noise
    eps_in = self._scale_noise(self.in_features)
    eps_out = self._scale_noise(self.out_features)
    self.eps_w.copy_(eps_out.ger(eps_in))
    self.eps_b.copy_(eps_out)

def forward(self, x):
    if self.training:
        return F.linear(x, self.mu_w + self.sigma_w * self.eps_w, self.mu_b + self.sigma_b * self.eps_b)
    else:
        # In evaluation mode, disable noise for deterministic actions
        return F.linear(x, self.mu_w, self.mu_b)
Section 2: Enhancing the Agent's "Vision"
2.1. Create a Richer State Representation

WHY: The agent needs more than just portfolio ratios. It needs to understand market momentum, its own performance, and the quality of its current position to make intelligent decisions.
WHERE: TradingEnvironment.__init__ and TradingEnvironment._get_state()
WHAT: First, update the feature count in the constructor. Then, replace the _get_state method entirely.
# In TradingEnvironment.__init__
# Updated feature count: normalized data + 7 new portfolio/market features
self.n_features = self.normalized_data.shape[1] + 7

# In TradingEnvironment class, replace the entire _get_state method
def _get_state(self):
start = self.current_step - self.window_size
end = self.current_step

# Market data (already normalized)
market_data = self.normalized_data.iloc[start:end].values

# Prices for calculations
current_price = self.data["Original_Close"].iloc[self.current_step]
prices_window = self.data["Original_Close"].iloc[start:end]

# --- New State Features ---
# 1. Portfolio Value & Ratios
portfolio_value = self.credit + self.holdings * current_price
holdings_ratio = (self.holdings * current_price) / portfolio_value if portfolio_value > 0 else 0
credit_ratio = self.credit / portfolio_value if portfolio_value > 0 else 0

# 2. Performance Indicators
credit_growth = (self.credit - self.initial_credit) / self.initial_credit

# 3. Position Quality
position_pnl = 0
if self.holdings > 0 and self.average_buy_price > 0:
    position_pnl = (current_price - self.average_buy_price) / self.average_buy_price

# 4. Market Momentum/Volatility
returns = prices_window.pct_change().fillna(0)
momentum_10 = returns.rolling(10).mean().iloc[-1] if len(returns) >= 10 else 0
volatility_30 = returns.rolling(30).std().iloc[-1] if len(returns) >= 30 else 0

# 5. Time in Episode
time_ratio = (self.current_step - self.window_size) / (len(self.data) - self.window_size)

# Combine into a single feature vector for each timestep in the window
state_features = np.array(
    [[holdings_ratio, credit_ratio, credit_growth, position_pnl, momentum_10, volatility_30, time_ratio]] * self.window_size
)

return np.concatenate([market_data, state_features], axis=1)
2.2. Update the Q-Network to Handle New State

WHY: The Q-Network's input dimensions must match the new state from the environment.
WHERE: QNetwork.__init__ and QNetwork.forward
WHAT: Adjust the slicing and dimensions to match the 7 new features.
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, attention_dim, attention_heads):
    super().__init__()
    # The number of non-market features is now 7
    self.num_portfolio_features = 7
    self.attention = SharedSelfAttention(state_dim - self.num_portfolio_features, attention_dim, attention_heads)
    
    combined_feature_dim = attention_dim + self.num_portfolio_features

    # Dueling Architecture: Advantage Stream
    self.fc_adv1 = NoisyLinear(combined_feature_dim, 256)
    self.fc_adv2 = NoisyLinear(256, action_dim)

    # Dueling Architecture: Value Stream
    self.fc_val1 = NoisyLinear(combined_feature_dim, 256)
    self.fc_val2 = NoisyLinear(256, 1)

def forward(self, state):
    # state shape: (batch, window_size, features)
    market_data = state[:, :, :-self.num_portfolio_features]
    portfolio_state = state[:, -1, -self.num_portfolio_features:] # Get latest portfolio state

    attention_output = self.attention(market_data)
    
    combined_input = torch.cat([attention_output, portfolio_state], dim=1)

    # ... rest of the forward method is unchanged ...
    adv = F.relu(self.fc_adv1(combined_input))
    adv = self.fc_adv2(adv)
    val = F.relu(self.fc_val1(combined_input))
    val = self.fc_val2(val)
    q_values = val + adv - adv.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    return q_values

# ... reset_noise method is unchanged ...
Section 3: Stabilizing and Accelerating Learning
3.1. Fix the Return Calculation Bug in Validation

WHY: As you noted, the return percentage was calculated incorrectly across segments, leading to confusing outputs like negative PV with positive returns.
WHERE: validate_in_segments()
WHAT: Calculate the return based on the segment's actual starting value.
# In validate_in_segments(), inside the loop, before appending to segment_metrics
    
    # --- FIX: Correct Return Calculation ---
    # The initial value for this segment is the portfolio value right before it starts.
    initial_segment_pv = credit_hist[0] if credit_hist else (current_credit + current_holdings * segment_data["Original_Close"].iloc[0])
    
    final_pv = pv_hist[-1] if pv_hist else current_credit
    
    if initial_segment_pv == 0:
        seg_return = 0.0
    else:
        # The return is the change in value over the segment's initial value.
        seg_return = (final_pv - initial_segment_pv) / initial_segment_pv * 100
3.2. Implement Soft Target Updates (Polyak Averaging)

WHY: Copying weights periodically (hard update) can destabilize learning. A slow, continuous blend (soft update) is much smoother and more robust.
WHERE: DQNAgent.update_target_network() and DQNAgent.learn()
WHAT: Change the update method and call it every learning step.
# In DQNAgent class, replace the update_target_network method
def update_target_network(self, tau=0.005):
"""Soft update model parameters.
Î¸_target = Ï„*Î¸_local + (1 - Ï„)*Î¸_target
"""
for target_param, policy_param in zip(self.target_net.parameters(), self.policy_net.parameters()):
    target_param.data.copy_(tau * policy_param.data + (1.0 - tau) * target_param.data)

# In DQNAgent.learn(), at the very end of the method, add this call:
    # Soft update the target network
    self.update_target_network()
3.3. Add Gradient Clipping

WHY: Prioritized Experience Replay can sometimes feed the network "shocking" experiences that result in massive gradients, destabilizing the weights. Clipping prevents this.
WHERE: DQNAgent.learn()
WHAT: Add one line just before the optimizer step.
# In DQNAgent.learn(), after loss.backward()
    loss.backward()
    # Gradient Clipping to prevent exploding gradients
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.policy_net.parameters(), 1.0)
    self.optimizer.step()
Section 4: Hyperparameters and Training Strategy
4.1. Adjust Key Hyperparameters

WHY: The new architecture and reward system require different settings to perform optimally.
WHERE: main() function
WHAT: Modify the hyperparameters at the top of main.
# ---------- HYPER-PARAMETERS ----------
EPISODES = 50
EPISODE_LENGTH_DAYS = 3  # Slightly longer episodes for more learning
BATCH_SIZE = 128         # Larger batch size for stability with PER
ATTENTION_DIM = 64       # More capacity for attention
ATTENTION_HEADS = 4
LEARNING_RATE = 1e-4     # A slightly higher LR can work with Adam and clipping
WINDOW_SIZE = 180
MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT_BUY = 1
MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT_SELL = 1
INITIAL_CREDIT = 100
VAL_EVAL_WINDOW_MINUTES = 48 * 60  # 2 days
4.2. Implement a Learning Rate Scheduler

WHY: A high learning rate is good for making progress early on, but a lower rate is needed later for fine-tuning. A scheduler automates this.
WHERE: main() function
WHAT: Add the scheduler after creating the agent and step it at the end of each episode.
# In main(), after creating the agent
agent = DQNAgent(...)

# Add a learning rate scheduler
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(agent.optimizer, step_size=EPISODES // 4, gamma=0.5)

# In main(), at the end of the training loop (after validation)
    scheduler.step() # Decay the learning rate
Implementation Roadmap
To avoid introducing too many changes at once, follow this phased approach:

Phase 1 (Critical Fix): Implement Section 1 changes only (Reward Function, Noisy Net Fix). Run for 5-10 episodes. Goal: Confirm the agent is now actively trading.
Phase 2 (Enhancement): Implement Section 2 (State Representation) and Section 3 (Stability/Bug Fixes). Run for 10-20 episodes. Goal: See if the agent's decisions are becoming more consistent and if credit is starting to grow.
Phase 3 (Tuning): Implement Section 4 (Hyperparameters). Run the full 50 episodes. Goal: Achieve significant and sustained capital growth.
Expected Results After All Changes
Active Trading: The agent will consistently execute 50-200 trades per validation segment.
Consistent Credit Growth: The validation charts will show the green "Credit" line steadily climbing, breaking new highs across segments, instead of stagnating or decaying.
Meaningful Returns: The mean segment return should be consistently positive and significant (e.g., 5-20%). The final test run should show a total return well over 100%.
Stable Learning: The model should not collapse, and performance should generally trend upwards over the 50 episodes.
Below is the complete, corrected code with all the above modifications integrated.
