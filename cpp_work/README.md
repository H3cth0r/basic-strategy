- Multiple Inheritance: allows a class to inherit from more than one base class, a feature called `multiple inheritance`. 
- Memory allocation: in cpp, dynamic memory allocation is managed using the `new` and `delete` operators. The `new` operator allocates memory on the heap at runtime, and it's essential to deallocate this memory using delete once it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
